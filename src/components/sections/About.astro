	<div class="space-y-2">
		<p>
			Growing up, I always had a passion for everything tech.
			<br />
			 I've got a few core memories that I remember really solidifed this
			passion for tech, the experiences it can give us, and generally developed
			my desire and ability to problem solve.
		</p>

		<p>
			These include things such as:
			<ul class="list-inside list-disc">
				<li>
					being 7 years old trying to figure out what a zip file was and how to
					open one so I could use Pivot Animator
				</li>
				<li>
					googling "how to program", resulting in an awful text adventure
					written using a batch file
				</li>
				<li>
					modding just about every game I got my hands on (I'm talking
					specifically about you Skyrim and Minecraft)
				</li>
				<li>and jailbreaking iPhones for my friends and I in highschool.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			These days I'm still just as passionate about tech, but I now come with
			more experience than just how to unzip stuff. Other technologies I like
			using include Astro, TypeScript, and Tailwind!
