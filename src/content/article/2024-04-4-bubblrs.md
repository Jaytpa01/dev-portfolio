**bubbler**  
_noun_ `AUSTRALIANâ€¢US`  
a drinking fountain.

Bubblrs is an idea my friend and I had a couple of years ago when we were out on a run. We were incredibly thirsty, didn't have any water, and couldn't find a bubbler anywhere. In that moment, all we wanted was a convenient way to find the closest bubbler.

Since we couldn't find a convenient way, I decided I would make one. So, I purchased a domain for it, then promptly sat on the idea for well over a year (if not longer) without making anything.

Recently, I've finally started working on it, primarily treating it as a way to experiment with various tools and technologies that I either want more practice with, or don't get a chance to use elsewhere.

My aim for it is to have it become a community-driven platform that helps people find, rate, and share the locations of bubbl(e)rs. At the moment though, its just a single-page application with static data for bubbler locations in and around Sydney, Australia hardcoded into the UI codebase.
