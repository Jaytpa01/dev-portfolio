  and why I decided to build this one.

I don’t know what exactly it is about it, but I don’t like my [old portfolio website](https://old.jayparry.dev/).

Don’t get me wrong, I’m proud of what I was able to build, especially while learning to build with [Astro](https://astro.build/).

Maybe it’s just some lingering imposter syndrome, but I don’t know - something about it feels off to me. The best way I can describe it is that it feels like something that’s pretending to be a website.

Maybe it’s the design / the colour palette?  
Maybe it’s that one obscure bug with the header I could never really resolve (the one that forces my code snippets to have a max line width otherwise the header unexpectedly stretches horizontally and squashes vertically).

The only thing I really like about it is the blog post tagging / filtering system I built (which I should definitely rebuild for this version – unless you’re reading this in the future and I’ve already done it, then you can just ignore this paragraph).

Either way, I rebuilt it, and that’s why this website now exists.

There’s still plenty of work left to do with this version, but I’m much happier with it.

Anyway, ramble over. Goodbye for now!
