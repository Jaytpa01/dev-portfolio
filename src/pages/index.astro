			Hey there! I'm Jay, a fullstack developer
			<span class="text-xs">

			<p>Growing up, I always had a passion for everything tech.</p>

			<p>
				From figuring out how to open a zip file to use Pivot Animator on my
				mum's work laptop at like 7 years old, to writing an awful text
				adventure using a batch file, modding just about every game I got my
				hands on (I'm talking about you Skyrim and Minecraft), and Jailbreaking
				iPhones for my friends and I in highschool.
			</p>
			<p>
				These are just some of the things that developed my problem solving
				skills and generally fostered my passion for tech and the experiences it
				can give us.
