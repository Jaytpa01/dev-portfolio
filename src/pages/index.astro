		<div class="space-y-1">
			<p>Growing up, I always had a passion for everything tech.</p>

			<p>
				There are a few core memories that developed my problem solving skills
				and generally fostered my passion for tech and the experiences it can
				give us:

				<ul class="list-disc">
					<li>
						Being like 7 years old figuring out how to open a zip file on my
						Mum's work laptop so I could use Pivot Animator
					</li>
					<li>
						googling "how to program", resulting in an awful text adventure
						written using a batch file
					</li>
					<li>
						modding just about every game I got my hands on (I'm talking about
						you Skyrim and Minecraft)
					</li>
					<li>Jailbreaking iPhones for my friends and I in highschool</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</div>

		<p>
			These days I'm still just as passionate about tech, but I now come with
			experience professionally building applications with Golang, Node.js,
			React, and Postgres.
		</p>

		<p>
			Other technologies I like using include Astro, TypeScript, and Tailwind!
