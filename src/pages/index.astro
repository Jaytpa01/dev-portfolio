			<div class="space-y-2">
				<p>
					Growing up, I always had a passion for everything tech.
					<br />
					 I've got a few core memories that I remember really solidifed this
					passion for tech, the experiences it can give us, and generally
					developed my desire and ability to problem solve.
				</p>

				<p>
					These include things such as:
					<ul class="list-inside list-disc">
						<li>
							being 7 years old trying to figure out what a zip file was and how
							to open one so I could use Pivot Animator
						</li>
						<li>
							googling "how to program", resulting in an awful text adventure
							written using a batch file
						</li>
						<li>
							modding just about every game I got my hands on (I'm talking
							specifically about you Skyrim and Minecraft)
						</li>
						<li>
							and jailbreaking iPhones for my friends and I in highschool.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p>
					These days I'm still just as passionate about tech, but I now come
					with more experience than just how to unzip stuff. Other technologies
					I like using include Astro, TypeScript, and Tailwind!
